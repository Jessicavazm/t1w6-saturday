# t1w6-Saturday

## Perform calculation using If, else statements

# Lists
* Composite data type = multiple data types can be stored in one variable
* Each piece is called element
* You can access elements in the list index, index starts at 0.
e.g:
countries = ["Brazil", "Australia", "Fiji"]

print(countries[2])

The printed output will be "Fiji"

* Remove data = .remove
* Add data = .append
* Count length .len

# Loops
Used to repeat a block of codes multiple times until a certain condition is met.

DRY coding principle: Don't repeat yourself.

Loops = how many times the user wants to run the intended block.

IF STATEMENT = If condition would decide wether or not to run the intended block.

# While loop
While the condition is met, keep executing the intended block, if not met, skip the block.
* Make sure program can meet condition to enter the loop
* Make sure program can meet condition to exit the loop
